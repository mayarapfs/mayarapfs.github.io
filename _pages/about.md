I received a PhD in Economics from MIT in June 2021, and am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

I'll be joining the faculty of Yale University in July 2024 as an Assistant Professor of Economics and Global Affairs, in a joint appointment between the Department of Economics and the Jackson School of Global Affairs. Before then I will spend a year at Princeton University as an IES Fellow, followed by a year at Yale as a Cowles Postdoctoral Associate. 

My research interests are in <span style="color:maroon">Development</span>, <span style="color:maroon">International Trade</span>, and <span style="color:maroon">Labor</span>. Within these fields, I am particularly interested in understanding how governments regulate firms, and the consequences therein.
