I received a PhD in Economics from MIT in June 2021, and am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. <br>
I'll be joining the faculty of Yale University in July 2024 as an Assistant Professor of Economics and Global Affairs, in a joint appointment between the Department of Economics and the Jackson School of Global Affairs. Before then I will spend a year at Princeton University as an IES Fellow, followed by a year at Yale as a Cowles Postdoctoral Associate. <br> My research interests are in <span style="color:maroon">Development</span>, <span style="color:maroon">Trade</span>, and <span style="color:maroon">Labor</span>.
