My research is in the fields of development and international trade. I study policies intended to improve market efficiency, such as import tariff reductions, free trade agreements, and outsourcing. A special focus of my research is firms' responses to these policies and their implications to competition, either in labor or product markets. I therefore often borrow methods and insights from the fields of labor, public, and industrial organization. My work is primarily on Latin America, with additional work in Indonesia.
