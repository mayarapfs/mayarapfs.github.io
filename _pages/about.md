I am an Assistant Professor of Economics and Global Affairs at Yale, jointly appointed at the <a href="https://economics.yale.edu" target="_blank">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://jackson.yale.edu" target="_blank">Jackson School of Global Affairs</a>. I am also an NBER Faculty Research Fellow, an EGC Faculty Affiliate, and an invited researcher at J-PAL Latin America.

My research is in the fields of development and international trade. I study the design and effects of policies intended to improve market efficiency in developing countries, such as import tariff reductions, free trade agreements, and outsourcing. A special focus of my research is firms' response to these policies and their implications to competition. My work is primarily on Latin America, with additional work in Indonesia.
